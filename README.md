<h1>1071. Greatest Common Divisor of Strings</h1>
<p> For two strings s and t, we say "t divides s" if and only if s = t + t + t + ... + t + t (i.e., t is concatenated with itself one or more times).
</br>
Given two strings str1 and str2, return the largest string x such that x divides both str1 and str2.</p>
